Ordered:
When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the item have a
defined order, and that order will not change.
Unchangeble: Tuples are unchangeble, menaing that we cannot change, add or remove
items after the tuple has been created.
Allow duplicates:
SInce tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

thistuple = ("apple","banana","cherry","apple","cherry")
print(thistuple)

#find the lenght of the tuple

print(thistuple)

# tuple is also recognized by its index no.
print(thistuple[0])
print(thistuple[3])

print(thistuple[2:5])
